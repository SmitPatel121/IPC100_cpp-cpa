1.Mapping of the month integer value to the first characters of the month name could have been accomplished using two possible construct

A)using  if else
 
example :

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{   int month;
    printf("enter value of month   in numerical format MM : ");
    scanf(" %d",&month);

    if (month==6)
	{
		printf("JUN");
       }	
    Else if (month==7)
	{
		printf(" JULY");
       }
       ....//until DEC we have to use else if statement
       
       return 0 ;	
}

B) Using switch 

  Example :
  
  
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	Int month ;
	
	printf(" Enter value of month in numerical format MM :”);
      scanf(" %d",&month);

	switch(month)
	{
	  Case 1:
	 	printf(" Jun");
		break;
		
		printf(" July");
		break;
// we have to write this until DEC
       	default;
       		printf(" Invalid");
       }
       
  Return 0 ;

}

So this are the two ways by which we can change integer value of month to the first three character of the month .


2.There are three iteration constructs
 i)While
 ii)do-while
 iii)for
 
In my program, I have used while loop as follows:
	#include <stdio.h>
       Int main ()
       {
       	Int month ;
       	printf(ÒEnter integer value for month: Ò);
       	scanf(" %d", %month);
       
       	int valid = 1;
       	bool Ifvalid = false ;
       	while(valid <= 12)
       	{
       	 If (valid == month)
			{
				ifValid = true ;
				break ;
       }
       valid ++ ;
       }
       	If (!ifValid)
       	{
       	   Printf("Invalid integer month provide")
       }
       return 0 ; 
       } 
       Reason: we need to traverse through the valid month integers to check if the input value is one of the valid values. I can do so using while as shown above .
       
       


3. To run and test the program, I used a main c program and executed it on various possible cases. Many times I got errors and to debug the issue, I used printf statements to inspect if the scanf function is getting correct inputs. I also used debug function in visual studio form the line which I get error.i have also used cs50.ide cloud based coad compiler from havard university it also prive debugging facility to debug the coad I find it better to use this function and it helps me a lot to solve the problem.
