[1] When naming a module or library, you must use the name that uses the purpose of using these libraries.

 Special characters are named to the library except _, which can lead to confusion. . H file and .c file main reason for OPF 
 The same library  is  very practical to understand that end users are both files, so they receive the same name. 
 It is processed in part of a single package. For example, core.h and core.c is pointed out that content has a kind similarity. 
 These files.

 
[2] Modules are an efficient  programming method that divides a large program into manageable parts. 
 The reason for using the  two modules in this program is to reduce the overall complexity of the  code when  viewed as small bits. 
 If you hadn't created the module, all the code was contained in  a .c file and a single file that was a coder. 
 Anyone who wants to change this work in the future will have to work hard to find the bugs and features they need. Instead, a single large code file is used. 
 A small module. The reason the  
 



[3] module is split into both  .c and  .h files is that  the code is easier to maintain and prototypes user-defined data types and all functions. Therefore, if a programmer wants to add  content to a user-defined data type, he can  change it directly in the .h file instead of looking for the content in  long  code.
