question 1: 
Answer:  Structural data can consume a large amount of memory due to the data entered and the data displayed according to its requirements 
. The "ReportData" structure requires bytes according to the  stored data. For example, "displayReportData" .

printf("%07d %10.2lf %10.1lf %10.4lf %9d %8d %8.1lf %7.2lf %7.5lf",
		info_report_info.price_sku, info_report_info.cost_rate, info_report_info.mass_weight, info_report_info.Kilo_gram_kg, info_report_info.gram_gm,
		info_report_info.cal_calories, info_report_info.Sum_total_service, info_report_info.Serve_per_weigh,
		info_report_info.per_cal_services);






question 2:
Answer:

struct ReportData
{
	int price_sku;
	
	int cal_calories;
	
	int gram_gm;
	
	double Sum_total_service;
	
	double Serve_per_weigh;
	
	double per_cal_services;
	
	double cost_rate;
	
	double mass_weight;
	
	double Kilo_gram_kg;
};


struct CatFoodInfo
{
	int price_sku;
	double product_rate;
	int cal_calories;
	double mass_weight_to_lb;
};


Here we have the same predefined variables for both structural data types, and we can also implement them in a single structure. 
  CatFoodInfo has four predefined variables, and these four variables  also exist in ReportData.
