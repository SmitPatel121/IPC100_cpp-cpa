1. In the milestone one the most challenging thing I found was the following part:

 void inputCString(char* car_string, int minim_number, int maxm_numb);  
 //decalring the 3 variable  and getting the char and int

I was not able to get the concepts so I have not applied correct condition so that the loop was not ending and it was continuous printing the message inside the loop . So to stop the iteration I used VS code editors debugging function and found the problem in the line and then I corrected the code and it worked .



2.   The main difference I found in the initialising the variable to 0 and setting it to NULL is that , if we assign the value 0 to an variable it has its value in all the code for all time but if we use NULL it has no value assigned so we can use it in code if we have use 0 in above variable.

if (Phone_num == NULL)
	{
		printf("(___)___-____"); return;
	}


3.  . First, I will discuss with my friend that what is the buffer "standard input buffer"  and how it works and  what  is more used, I will give all the basic information like from basic variable declaration to declaration function.  I will give them some important notes that will help him have Overview of buffers so that you can clearly. Buffer concept. Then I will tell him to relate the notes from my explanation. I know I am not a good teacher, but I can try to teach him in the way I learned this things so I would be easy for him to understand this topis. Once these things we will discuss your problem about  my friend's problem. When he / she has trouble managing "standard input buffers", especially in the remaining data. I will help me through different examples, moreover, and I will put some questions to know that he is getting the topic or not and getting more about it. But he/she still doesn't understand the subject. I will start explaining to him/her from the basic concept. Just like a buffer is an area of memory that holds data temporarily. I'll walk him through the  visual studio and explain him the different code just like our professor to get through  code.
